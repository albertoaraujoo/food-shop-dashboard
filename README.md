## üî• Introduction

The project helps restaurant and pizzeria owners better control their business. Users have access to order data, can change statuses, and filter them. Additionally, they obtain financial data for the day, month, and more. Graphs are also used to represent this data.

The front end was built with React, using other technologies such as shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Query, and Zod. The back end was built with Bun, using Docker for deployment, and a PostgreSQL database.

Unit tests were conducted with Jest and RTL, E2E tests were conducted with Playwright and MSW for the mocks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
